# Travall - Catalogue

This is a project I made for small car accessories company.

It uses jQuery/JS to parse a JSON file via AJAX to lay out a simple one page catalogue.

I thought it might be useful to someone trying to learn AJAX.

Obviously you'll need to change all the URLs to whatever you need.

Have fun!
